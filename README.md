# Tic Tac Toe

Second project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s JavaScript Course: a classic Tic Tac Toe game.

The goal of this project was to practice organizing the code using factory functions, the module pattern and separation of concerns, all while trying to minimize global scope.

The game also had its logic first built and tested in the console before implementing the DOM interface.
